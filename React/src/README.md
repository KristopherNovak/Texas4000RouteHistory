# Src folder

The src folder includes all the source code for the frontend of this project (besides the index.html file, which is located in the parent folder). Main.jsx is the file that is run initially and mainly functions to set the React App up as an Apollo client as well as to call App.jsx. App.jsx meanwhile, includes more or less all the HTML elements that are rendered in the page. App.css includes some minor CSS formatting, but the bulk of the relevant formatting is in the index.css file.

The components folder includes the various React components that appear on the page and the object folder includes specifications of the parameters that are used to control the React components for this specific application. More detailed information about these folders can be found in the README.md file for these folders.
