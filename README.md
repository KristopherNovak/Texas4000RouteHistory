# Texas4000RouteHistory

This repository includes all the relevant code used to create Texas4000RouteHistory.com. Texas4000RouteHistory.com is a website that displays information about all of the places that Texas 4000 has visited during its 20 years of history biking from Austin, TX to Anchorage, AK and giving grants to cancer research institutes. The website has functionality to allow a user to filter out what the map shows and also has multiple views (a couple desktop views and one mobile view).

## Navigating this repository
The React folder includes the uncompiled React code for the frontend of the website and the NodeJS folder includes the code that is currently being run by the backend of the website (which mainly functions to serve relevant files for setting up the frontend and to respond to GraphQL queries).
